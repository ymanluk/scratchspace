 - Tips, tricks, concepts
		○ Tips: You do not have to understand every single part of the code to make things work; if the sample is simple, it can be as easy as changing the data source 
		○ Tips: Focus on the part of the code
		○ Tips: Be careful of the indentation, affects the running of functions
		○ Tips: sometimes it is better to only make one change at a time to identify the issue
		○ Tricks: use search to see how a certain function or variable is working in the code
		○ Concept: the major processes occurring in the SDK can be compared to the ETL process: to extract the desired data from the source, and then transform it to a format that can be loaded for display, where the format is the chart structure in our case.
	- Future possibilities to improve
		○ Add in more data layers, ideally show everything in a single map
	- Project missteps
		○ Debugging
		○ Not targeting the right code
	- Technical challenges
		○ Identifying/modifying the right parts of the code to fix things or make things work
	- Mistakes made
		○ Being too aggressive
			§ Making too much of a change at once
			§ Trying to add significant amount of codes to add a certain feature, road to failure

 
Best of luck in your project!
